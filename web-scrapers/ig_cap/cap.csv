0,"During this month's Esplanade cleanup on February 18th, we had 31 awesome volunteers. 

We had a very successful day collecting a total of over 180 pounds of garbage and 30 pounds of recycling. Someone even found an abandoned shopping cart! We also got 1,063 cigarette butts, 227 of which were from our cigarette butt container. 

Thanks so much to everyone who came out and helped clean up. We can’t wait to see you next month!

1,"Boyan Slat, the 28-year-old Dutch entrepreneur and founder of non-profit environmental organization The Ocean Cleanup, has been working on ways to filter plastic waste out of the Pacific Ocean for nearly 10 years . According to BBC News , he said the journey had been harder than he ever imagined it would be.

The Scale of the Problem 
The Ocean Cleanup uses a long , u-shaped barrier, similar to a net, that is pulled through patches of rubbish by boats. It moves slowly to avoid harming marine life. The system has so far cleaned up almost 200,000 kilograms (440,000 lbs) of ocean plastic.

The Ocean Cleanup's Filtering Process 
Research conducted by the company in 2021 suggests that about 1,000 of the world 's rivers are the source of 80% of the global ocean plastic pollution. To stop the plastic in rivers, The Ocean Cleanup uses its &quot;Interceptor&quot; solutions, and aims to scale this to all 1,000 heaviest polluting rivers in the world. The tech behind these varies according to factors such as width, depth, flow speed , and debris type of the river in question, assessed using AI -powered cameras.

Scaling Up Operations 
Boyan said the fast-flowing nature of rivers can make stopping plastic even more difficult. &quot;In rivers, you really only have one shot at catching the plastic—it just flows by and if you don't catch it, it's guaranteed to enter the ocean,&quot; he said. He added that the rivers are really the arteries that carry trash from land to sea, so when it rains, plastic washes from streets into creeks, into rivers, and then ultimately to the ocean.

Intercepting Plastic in Rivers 
According to Boyan, &quot;The planet is pretty big, it turns out,&quot; adding that there are about 1,000 rivers that need to be tackled and five ocean garbage patches. The f…

Thank you to our Junior Site Captains: Anya, Stuti, and Lipika, you were all super helpful! Thank you Naturalist Nat, and Gail for helping with Junior Site Captains!

Overall the 32 volunteers picked up 34 lbs of trash, 10 lbs of recycling, and ~3000 cigarette butts collected (almost filled a two-gallon bucket)! 

Continuing from previous cleanups lots of cigarette butts were collected, as well as vaporizers, but a car fender was definitely unique this time! 

Next month's cleanup in Foster City will be at the Marina Plaza Shopping Center on Sunday, March 19th. Address: 2920 S Norfolk St, San Mateo, CA 94403. Please register online, it saves time and paper!

This week, our ODA Oahu crew made it to Spitting Cave, a popular cliffside recreational fishing site where many lines and hooks are lost to the waters below.

The end of the day yielded 50 pounds of weight and a couple of hundred yards of fishing line. Thank you to Island Divers Hawaii and our wonderful ODA volunteers for making our oceans cleaner than before!

These guys do epic trash cleaning missions and I’m so glad we connected through @khakiandocean and I was able to join them today.

About 250kgs of human trash - bottles, bags, chip packets, shoes, fishing gear and polystyrene.

Crazy to see how much there was, especially after already cleaning some of these sections already.

Keep up the great work !!

6,"The Ocean Clean Up @theoceancleanup are working to remove plastic from the world’s oceans and has so far removed over a whopping 100,000kg of rubbish from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch! Inspired by the cause and their efforts, Airbnbs @airbnb owner Joe Gebbia donated $25 million in support. 

If you hadn’t heard, there’s a massive “island” of plastic the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean and The Ocean Clean Up is dedicated to its removal. Not all heroes wear capes 🦸‍♂️💚🌎

7,"Today's #FeelGoodFriday takes us to the  Great Pacific Garbage Patch or GPGP (located between Hawai’i and California) where a big development has been made in a non-profit's effort to clean up our oceans.

Last year we discussed Ocean Cleanup and how their ocean cleaning system, System 002, has already removed close to 440,000 pounds of plastic from the GPGP that otherwise would have remained trapped for decades or more.  Recently, the co-founder of Airbnb has just donated $25 million to support this Dutch nonprofit as they prepare to assemble and deploy the largest plastic capture system ever developed for use in the ocean - System 03. This new system cleans ten times faster than the previous system and could clean all the plastic patches of the world’s oceans with about 10-50 systems!  2023 is shaping up to be a great year in the fight against plastic pollution!

8,"We wanted to share with you some happy eco news! We know the news can be overwhelming with lots of terrible things happening, so we wanted to take a moment to celebrate something positive and feel-good.

The Ocean Cleanup is doing amazing work removing plastic pollution from the ocean. Last summer System 002 alone completed 61 extractions of a total of 194,092kg of plastic out of the ocean, and is now on a well-deserved winter break until March 2023 for maintenance.

At PurePods we believe every bit of plastic waste counts, which is why our PurePods water filters use 60% less plastic than competitors, and our cartridge is reusable!

9,"Thank you to the 96 volunteers, who cleaned the beach, streets, parking areas, pier, and even some of the golf course last Saturday at Sharp Park, Pacifica, CA! Woot woot! 

Huge thanks to the students from Saint Francis High School who joined fellow volunteers to remove 1085 Cigarette Filter (350 from the Pier), 227 pounds of trash including three battered, beat-up tires that washed up on the beach, and 125 recyclable materials.

A bucket of plastic film pieces was recovered from the beach. Enough plastic netting was picked out of the sand in the picnic area to fill a 5-gallon bucket.  It was clearly residue left behind from sod that was installed years and years ago and now uncovered from the strong waves of the past storms.

Volunteers from St. Francis High School included club members from BRIC Brothers, BRIC Sisters, the ocean club, and the environmental club. Big thanks to Tiffany (wearing the yellow jacket in the first photo) who catalyzed these students to join us, it's a perfect example of how one person can create a huge difference!

As a National Finalist for @australia_galaxy_pageants I had so much fun continuing my volunteer work to clean up our beaches with this local Northern Beaches organisation. 

So many people coming together to pick up microplastics from the shore, count and survey them. Microplastics are tiny plastic particles (a breakdown of larger plastics) that we and creatures end up ingesting which can be harmful. Today, the crew collected 3kgs of microplastics. 

Pittwater Eco Adventures run school workshops to educate kids - here are some displays of the categories of plastic, as well as a demonstration of how plastic bottle caps can be recycled and repurposed into other products like a key chain!!

Since deployment in August 2021, System 002 (or “Jenny”) has now collected 101,353 kg of plastic over 45 extractions, sweeping an area of ocean of over 3000km2 – comparable to the size of Luxembourg or Rhode Island. Added to the 7,173 kg of plastic captured by our previous prototype systems, The Ocean Cleanup has now collected 108,526 kg of plastic from the GPGP – more than the combined weight of two and a half Boeing 737-800s, or the dry weight of a space shuttle!

17,"During this month's cleanup at Esplanade, a total of 17 volunteers joined PBC captains, including a couple high schoolers training to be junior site captains! It was a successful day even though there were high tide and king tide conditions which made it unsafe to go down to the beach. So instead, volunteers focused their efforts on the streets and in the neighborhood.

Volunteers collected 75.5 pounds of garbage which is an average of about 4.5 pounds of trash per person! Additionally, 11 pounds of recycling and 742 cigarette butts. Wowza!

Thank you so much to everyone who participated in this month's cleanup, we can’t wait to see you at our next one!

• Rope
• Clothes
• Canned drinks 

Weight of trash :  37.71 kg 

Number of heroes : 10
• 6 adults 
• 4 kids
(And 2 adult runners helped us transport the trash at the end)
Thank you to all volunteers 🙌🙏💛 

Sponsors : 
• Jue Ahmad & family : Thank you for the used sacks/gunny bags
• Private contractors engaged to clean the park : we appreciate the massive bin to dispose of the trash collected 

We were fortunate the weather cleared up for our Chinese New Year beach clean up at Taman Gelora. This was our first attempt at a clean up here, and certainly will not be our last! The monsoon brought lots of single use plastic bags which were caught on the mangrove plants. 

We were joined by regular and new volunteers. It is always lovely meeting people who share our views on caring for the environment. 

As it is Chinese New Year, every volunteer received a mandarin as a  treat 🍊🍊 Gong Xi Gong Xi and we appreciate all of you! 

There is still a lot more plastic trash to clean up at Pantai Taman Gelora, and we hope to do this on another day. If you regularly use the park, do check out the beach area. We hope to organise another clean up here and could do with more help. 

Our events are run completely by volunteers. If you would like to volunteer at our next clean up, look out for updates on our IG or FB page. If you would like to sponsor used bags/sacks/pickers/tshirts/stationery (or anything else which may aid our clean ups and our educational Kids Programme), please send us a message. Thank you 🙏🙂

25,"Disabled beach cleanup. If I can, we all can. I spent 2 hours collecting all this off a 5km stretch of beach. It’s almost impossible for me to walk in soft sand due to my ankle and knee injuries and pain but I just couldn’t drive past it. Spent the next 24 hours off my feet because of the pain I put myself through. There’s probably a km of ropes, 1000’s of small pieces of micro plastics, 15 floats, 30 glass and plastic bottles. Around 100 plastic bags and some metal objects. Some timber beams and plenty of smaller pieces. Estimating about 200kgs. The biggest issue here is that I take it off the beach but as there’s no proper way of recycling all this plastic in year 2023, it ends up in landfill. It breaks my heart to know we produce so much of this awful single use plastic that I’m just having it moved to another place for it to continue being the planet’s problem. Manufacturing of all plastic products must have an ethical disposal or recycling procedure if we’re to continue consuming and disposing of this stuff. We’ve trashed the planet so badly in just the last 100 years it’s frightening what our legacy is for the next generations and the health of our oceans and land environments. I’ve been cleaning up beaches/parks/ bush for a very long time and it’s getting worse. Let’s do better and if something doesn’t belong in nature, remove it because the litterer won’t. ✌🏼🌏

Hey ocean lovers! These storms are rad, and there’s so many waves to catch. Please consider picking up trash for just 15 minutes after surfing. I collected 15 pounds of trash that quickly. Lower tides are best. Let’s catch this crap before it all goes back into the ocean. 

On that note, how about these corporations making millions every quarter be responsible for their garbage reclamation?!? France is leading the way. Let’s move U.S.!

It was heartening to see the enthusiastic young girls happily cleaning the beach inspite of their difficult background. We had some regular volunteers join in too which is always a pleasure! 💛 

If you would like to volunteer at our next clean up, look out for updates on our IG or FB page. If you would like to sponsor used bags/sacks, pickers or tshirts for our volunteers (or anything else which may aid our clean ups), do drop us a message. Thank you 🙏

37,"2022 was an incredible year and despite severe floods in KZN and another year impacted by COVID not only can we say we made it, but we also managed to achieve alot to be proud of. 

Our final newsletter of 2022 covered our highlights for last year one of which was the Umhlanga River blockage in January. 

After the storms and heavy rains earlier in January, we took to social media to show the extent of damage in the Umhlanga River where we quickly deployed a team of 20 staff. 

To paint a picture, the plastic ‘blockage’ was approximately 3 meters deep and 70m upstream, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of kgs of plastic pollution.

What followed was a spectacular show of teamwork, with many organisations and individuals from around the world rallying together to remedy this bad situation!

A significant R200 000 was raised and allowed us to expand our team to 20 and deploy a TLB, as well as tractors and trailers (thanks to local farmer Rob West).

It was a tremendous feat due to our communities support and belief we were able to tackle this environmental disaster and cleared a massive 150 000kgs of waste.

38,"A hodgepodge of mini cleanups today… First stop, Humarock Beach parking lot, mostly doggy doodoo bags dropped by dodos. 

Next, the rear of the former Bank of America building on Front Street; the slow decay has accelerated and the graffiti artists are tagging it — This needs to be cleaned up. We removed the broken glass from the scene but this mess requires professional help. The deteriorating building is situated on the estuary which forms where Satuit Brook meets the Atlantic Ocean.

Last stop: Greenbush... We tidied up the path between New Driftway and Ford Place. Many nips, some fast food service, and more graffiti, this time a giant black and red caterpillar. The black body looks to be covering up writing. I think a coat of paint colored to match the wall is needed to discourage further artful contributions. The graffiti is a disturbing trend, keeping in mind the Broken Windows Theory which states that when low level crimes like vandalism are ignored, higher level and more serious crimes begin to occur.

Today’s total weight: 4.5 pounds
Number of nip bottles collected: 11

39,"In December, a team of staff and guests removed 376 kg of plastic debris from the beaches of St Francois Island! 💪🏼

Unfortunately, this represents only a year of debris accumulation on only half the island which gives insight to just how much plastic pollution affects these remote oceanic atolls. 

A massive well done to:

Encouraging you to get involved with beach and river clean-ups in your area this year as well as be conscious about your consumption so we can tackle the #plasticplague together!

40,"Museum Beach was the focus of our efforts today. The storm surge swept in loads of marine debris: nylon rope, styrofoam bits, bottle caps, the omnipresent alcohol containers, and our cute new friend, a Barbie Chelsea Color Reveal doll! She lost her hairpiece, her skirt, and her shoes in the storm, but she loves her new shovel. 

In addition to the debris that surged in, Museum Beach has a serious problem with doggie doodoo bags. I hate to use a cutesy name for this disgusting item that dog owners seem compelled to toss in any direction in this town. One true nut job in the Museum Beach area has a penchant for flinging their doggie doodoo bags *at* the dumpster belonging to Scituate Yacht Club. They don’t even bother to throw the bags into the dumpster, they pile them up beside it. Then let us note the numerous piles of doggie doodoo that are left on the beach outside of bags. 

The debris that we cleaned up today weighed 11 pounds. We also moved an orange kayak that some selfish and uncaring soul had left overturned on the beachgrass. The lack of couth is bewildering.

""The cleanup has been a monumental effort from our team on the ground. They have worked tirelessly in challenging and ever changing conditions and their commitment to cleaning as much waste as possible from that estuary and surrounding coastline has been impressive. 

We have formed a great relationship with the eThekwini Parks Department and this project would not have been possible without having them at our side. They committed themselves 100% and have not let us down one bit and we look forward to future collaborations with their department. 

As we round off our 1-month strike clean of the estuary we will look to see what measures we can take to further our impact there and continue protecting that important ecosystem.' - Josh Redman, Operations Manager, The Litterboom Project
