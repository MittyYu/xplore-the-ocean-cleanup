According to BBC News , he said the journey had been harder than he ever imagined it would be.

The Scale of the Problem 
The Ocean Cleanup uses a long , u-shaped barrier, similar to a net, that is pulled through patches of rubbish by boats. It moves slowly to avoid harming marine life. The system has so far cleaned up almost 200,000 kilograms (440,000 lbs) of ocean plastic.

The Ocean Cleanup's Filtering Process 
Research conducted by the company in 2021 suggests that about 1,000 of the world 's rivers are the source of 80% of the global ocean plastic pollution. To stop the plastic in rivers, The Ocean Cleanup uses its &quot;Interceptor&quot; solutions, and aims to scale this to all 1,000 heaviest polluting rivers in the world. The tech behind these varies according to factors such as width, depth, flow speed , and debris type of the river in question, assessed using AI -powered cameras.

Scaling Up Operations 
Boyan said the fast-flowing nature of rivers can make stopping plastic even more difficult. &quot;In rivers, you really only have one shot at catching the plastic‚Äîit just flows by and if you don't catch it, it's guaranteed to enter the ocean,&quot; he said. He added that the rivers are really the arteries that carry trash from land to sea, so when it rains, plastic washes from streets into creeks, into rivers, and then ultimately to the ocean.

Intercepting Plastic in Rivers 
According to Boyan, &quot;The planet is pretty big, it turns out,&quot; adding that there are about 1,000 rivers that need to be tackled and five ocean garbage patches. The f‚Ä¶

Recently, the co-founder of Airbnb has just donated $25 million to support this Dutch nonprofit as they prepare to assemble and deploy the largest plastic capture system ever developed for use in the ocean - System 03. This new system cleans ten times faster than the previous system and could clean all the plastic patches of the world‚Äôs oceans with about 10-50 systems!  2023 is shaping up to be a great year in the fight against plastic pollution!

Huge thanks to the students from Saint Francis High School who joined fellow volunteers to remove 1085 Cigarette Filter (350 from the Pier), 227 pounds of trash including three battered, beat-up tires that washed up on the beach, and 125 recyclable materials.

A bucket of plastic film pieces was recovered from the beach. Enough plastic netting was picked out of the sand in the picnic area to fill a 5-gallon bucket.  It was clearly residue left behind from sod that was installed years and years ago and now uncovered from the strong waves of the past storms.

Volunteers from St. Francis High School included club members from BRIC Brothers, BRIC Sisters, the ocean club, and the environmental club. Big thanks to Tiffany (wearing the yellow jacket in the first photo) who catalyzed these students to join us, it's a perfect example of how one person can create a huge difference!

As a National Finalist for @australia_galaxy_pageants I had so much fun continuing my volunteer work to clean up our beaches with this local Northern Beaches organisation. 

So many people coming together to pick up microplastics from the shore, count and survey them. Microplastics are tiny plastic particles (a breakdown of larger plastics) that we and creatures end up ingesting which can be harmful. Today, the crew collected 3kgs of microplastics. 

Pittwater Eco Adventures run school workshops to educate kids - here are some displays of the categories of plastic, as well as a demonstration of how plastic bottle caps can be recycled and repurposed into other products like a key chain!!

‚Ä¢ Rope
‚Ä¢ Clothes

‚Ä¢ Jue Ahmad & family : Thank you for the used sacks/gunny bags
‚Ä¢ Private contractors engaged to clean the park : we appreciate the massive bin to dispose of the trash collected 

We were fortunate the weather cleared up for our Chinese New Year beach clean up at Taman Gelora. This was our first attempt at a clean up here, and certainly will not be our last! The monsoon brought lots of single use plastic bags which were caught on the mangrove plants. 

We were joined by regular and new volunteers. It is always lovely meeting people who share our views on caring for the environment. 

As it is Chinese New Year, every volunteer received a mandarin as a  treat üçäüçä Gong Xi Gong Xi and we appreciate all of you! 

There is still a lot more plastic trash to clean up at Pantai Taman Gelora, and we hope to do this on another day. If you regularly use the park, do check out the beach area. We hope to organise another clean up here and could do with more help. 

Our events are run completely by volunteers. If you would like to volunteer at our next clean up, look out for updates on our IG or FB page. If you would like to sponsor used bags/sacks/pickers/tshirts/stationery (or anything else which may aid our clean ups and our educational Kids Programme), please send us a message.

If I can, we all can. I spent 2 hours collecting all this off a 5km stretch of beach.

Spent the next 24 hours off my feet because of the pain I put myself through. There‚Äôs probably a km of ropes, 1000‚Äôs of small pieces of micro plastics, 15 floats, 30 glass and plastic bottles. Around 100 plastic bags and some metal objects. Some timber beams and plenty of smaller pieces. Estimating about 200kgs. The biggest issue here is that I take it off the beach but as there‚Äôs no proper way of recycling all this plastic in year 2023, it ends up in landfill. It breaks my heart to know we produce so much of this awful single use plastic that I‚Äôm just having it moved to another place for it to continue being the planet‚Äôs problem.

Our final newsletter of 2022 covered our highlights for last year one of which was the Umhlanga River blockage in January. 

After the storms and heavy rains earlier in January, we took to social media to show the extent of damage in the Umhlanga River where we quickly deployed a team of 20 staff. 

To paint a picture, the plastic ‚Äòblockage‚Äô was approximately 3 meters deep and 70m upstream, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of kgs of plastic pollution.

What followed was a spectacular show of teamwork, with many organisations and individuals from around the world rallying together to remedy this bad situation!

A significant R200 000 was raised and allowed us to expand our team to 20 and deploy a TLB, as well as tractors and trailers (thanks to local farmer Rob West).

It was a tremendous feat due to our communities support and belief we were able to tackle this environmental disaster and cleared a massive 150 000kgs of waste.

Last stop: Greenbush... We tidied up the path between New Driftway and Ford Place. Many nips, some fast food service, and more graffiti, this time a giant black and red caterpillar. The black body looks to be covering up writing. I think a coat of paint colored to match the wall is needed to discourage further artful contributions.

In addition to the debris that surged in, Museum Beach has a serious problem with doggie doodoo bags. I hate to use a cutesy name for this disgusting item that dog owners seem compelled to toss in any direction in this town. One true nut job in the Museum Beach area has a penchant for flinging their doggie doodoo bags *at* the dumpster belonging to Scituate Yacht Club. They don‚Äôt even bother to throw the bags into the dumpster, they pile them up beside it. Then let us note the numerous piles of doggie doodoo that are left on the beach outside of bags. 

The debris that we cleaned up today weighed 11 pounds. We also moved an orange kayak that some selfish and uncaring soul had left overturned on the beachgrass. The lack of couth is bewildering.

After 61 extractions and 194,092 kg of plastic out of the ocean, their System 002 is going on winter break. 2022 in numbers:

- 8 trips into the Great Pacific Garbage Patch on cleaning operations
- Over 150 days at sea (including transit)
- 153,000 kg of plastic removed from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
- 4 consecutive trips with catch totals over 25,000 kg
- 99.9% of catch comprising only plastic

""As we enter winter, it is time to bring our system back to port for scheduled evaluation and upgrades as part of the ongoing transition to the larger and more efficient System 03. We are scheduled to head back out to restart cleaning the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in March 2023.""

On #worldcleanupday2022 we were engaged by @dhlexpresspakistan and @hapaglloydag to clean up a portion of #turtlebeach.

A HUGE thank you to @rlccpk for providing upcycled block printed bags made out of newspaper! And also to CEO RLCC Somayeh Bardai for giving a talk on waste management while @ahshabbar was way.

Together, we ended up picking up 714 kg of waste. Out of which 250 kg was #plastic, 22 kg was #paper, 18 kg was tetrapak, 26 kg was #glass, 53 kg was #cloth and a whopping (yet not surprising) 66 kg was #shoes (Yes. Shoes. 545 pieces to be exact!) with the rest being landfill trash.

We need to keep in mind that beaches across #Pakistan are some of the dirtiest in the world. So, we want to thank HL, and DHL deeply for their efforts to clean up!

Thank you to everyone who joined an organized cleanup, did their own cleanup, restored a native habitat, supported, or attended our 25th anniversary of the California Coastal Cleanup Day! 

Our results in these photos, but statewide, more than 27,000 volunteers helped in the effort. (With 60 percent of cleanup sites reporting, the count stands at 27,185 volunteers.) Those volunteers picked up 220,861 pounds of trash and an additional 29,702 pounds of recyclable materials ‚Äî for a total of 250,563 pounds or 125 tons. Impressive!

See you next September for the next CCCD, but remember any day can be a cleanup day here in California, or anywhere!

Another swim and lounge wear brand is Vitamin A who, over a 10 year period, analyzed their supply chain in order to procure suppliers for creating their own swimwear fabric made from recycled materials. This process saves water during production, diverts waste from landfills and the ocean, reduces emissions and saves many kWh of energy - all stats which are provided on their website. Vitamin A also donates a portion of their sales to multiple organizations protecting our oceans. Another great swim and lounge wear brand!

It‚Äôs good for the planet and your mental health - it‚Äôs a win-win!
So far this year my wonderful group of volunteers have collected a staggering amount of rubbish from our local beaches.
194.8 kg of general waste and 61kg of mixed recycling, cans, glass, plastic bottles, metal and wood. This doesn‚Äôt even include the very large pieces of metal and plastic which I am unable to weigh. 

At One Bag Beach Clean we work alongside many other local community groups and businesses down here in Cornwall. SO, a big shout out to all you amazing people out there, you know who you are! Together we really can make a difference.

Waste from the US anJ  gets sucked into the Great Garbage Patch ‚Äì an area of the Pacific between the US and Japan. The 'Patch' covers some 1.6 million square kilometres and contains around 100 million kilograms of plastic.

@TheOceanCleanup is a non-profit organisation that wants to remove 90% of the Patch‚Äôs floating plastic by 2040. Its net-based System 002 has already removed more than 100,000kg of plastic from the patch. Now, the organisation is working on System 003 and based on a recently-released concept video, it looks pretty awesome.

System 003 will use drones to identify waste hotspots and direct the three-ship net system to the location. Two ships will tow a massive 1,600-meter wide and four-meter deep screening system between them. The screening system funnels plastic waste into a central net. When full, the team empty the net onto a third boat, where the plastic is sorted and stored in onboard shipping containers for subsequent recycling. The slow towing speed of the system (0.75m/s) should allow most marine life to avoid being caught up (though I do wonder what will happen to jellyfish).

The Ocean Cleanup plans to create a fleet of ten System 003 machines in the coming months. You can follow their progress on Twitter and Instagram.

Happy Giving Tuesday to all of our Guardians. Thank you for your support. It has made a huge impact in 2022. Please consider supporting us in 2023, so we can continue to host bigger and better beach cleanups every year. (t-shirts make great gifts, 15% off, promo code: GiveOn22)

As you can see, our K59 beach cleanups were extremely productive, up to 800 lbs of trash or more. And that's 100% due to the enthusiasm and hard work of the local surfers, photographers, fisherman, and other volunteers who put in the sweat.

We hope you have a great holiday and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in 2023.

As well as our other more permanent sites, our teams are still hard at work in the Ohlanga Estuary where we have increased our staff from 11 to 20 to take advantage of the low water levels, which have made a lot of areas more accessible. We can now clear a lot more of the plastic and prevent it from entering our oceans. 

As of yesterday afternoon, in the Ohlanga Estuary alone the team has cleared 1330 black bags for landfill and 920kgs of recyclables. An absolutely incredible effort! 

We couldn't do any of this without your help. If you would like to Give Back to our Oceans this #GivingTuesday and support our work please follow the link in our profile for ways to donate. 

Even small donations can make a big difference!

After this plastic bag shred I got handfuls of small pieces of plastic and band-aids - some snatched out of fish mouths :( After photographing those gorgeous jellies the other day, I thought the clear plastic bags were jellies until i got up close. 
.
Tuesday musings. Scientists estimate that more than 11 million metric tons of plastic enters the oceans **every year** And to answer the big question, yes, you picking up that one shred does make a difference - to the turtle or fish that won't eat it now. (and. um hypothetically, since there are over 7.8 billion people 3 lbs per person per year would knock that one out ;) )

The seabeds of the Larvotto Marine Protected Area as well as the beach were cleaned on Saturday October 08 thanks to the involvement of 27 divers from the AMPN and the Club d‚ÄôExploration Sous-Marine de Monaco (CESMM) and 6 ground volunteers. In total, 75kg of marine litter was collected as well as 3kg of land litter consisting mainly of cigarette butts. Some waste could have been avoided by adopting more responsible behavior!

A big THANKS to the entire team of divers from the Club d'Exploration Sous-Marine de Monaco for their permanent involvement and to the other volunteers who took part in this operation.
 
THANK YOU also to the Soci√©t√© Mon√©gasque d'Assainissement (@greenmonaco_by_sma ) for providing the waste collection bin and the scale as well as for the presence of the jet-ski to collect the bags brought back by the divers.

Au total, ce sont 75kg de d√©chets marins qui ont √©t√© r√©colt√©s ainsi que 3kg de d√©chets terrestres constitu√©s essentiellement de m√©gots de cigarettes.
