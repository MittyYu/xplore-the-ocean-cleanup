0,"During this month's Esplanade cleanup on February 18th, we had 31 awesome volunteers. 

We had a very successful day collecting a total of over 180 pounds of garbage and 30 pounds of recycling. Someone even found an abandoned shopping cart! We also got 1,063 cigarette butts, 227 of which were from our cigarette butt container. 

Thanks so much to everyone who came out and helped clean up. We can’t wait to see you next month!

1,"Boyan Slat, the 28-year-old Dutch entrepreneur and founder of non-profit environmental organization The Ocean Cleanup, has been working on ways to filter plastic waste out of the Pacific Ocean for nearly 10 years . According to BBC News , he said the journey had been harder than he ever imagined it would be.

The Scale of the Problem 
The Ocean Cleanup uses a long , u-shaped barrier, similar to a net, that is pulled through patches of rubbish by boats. It moves slowly to avoid harming marine life. The system has so far cleaned up almost 200,000 kilograms (440,000 lbs) of ocean plastic.

The Ocean Cleanup's Filtering Process 
Research conducted by the company in 2021 suggests that about 1,000 of the world 's rivers are the source of 80% of the global ocean plastic pollution. To stop the plastic in rivers, The Ocean Cleanup uses its &quot;Interceptor&quot; solutions, and aims to scale this to all 1,000 heaviest polluting rivers in the world. The tech behind these varies according to factors such as width, depth, flow speed , and debris type of the river in question, assessed using AI -powered cameras.

Scaling Up Operations 
Boyan said the fast-flowing nature of rivers can make stopping plastic even more difficult. &quot;In rivers, you really only have one shot at catching the plastic—it just flows by and if you don't catch it, it's guaranteed to enter the ocean,&quot; he said. He added that the rivers are really the arteries that carry trash from land to sea, so when it rains, plastic washes from streets into creeks, into rivers, and then ultimately to the ocean.

Intercepting Plastic in Rivers 
According to Boyan, &quot;The planet is pretty big, it turns out,&quot; adding that there are about 1,000 rivers that need to be tackled and five ocean garbage patches. The f…

3,"Foster City’s Site Captains held a great cleanup last weekend! 

Thank you to our Junior Site Captains: Anya, Stuti, and Lipika, you were all super helpful! Thank you Naturalist Nat, and Gail for helping with Junior Site Captains!

Overall the 32 volunteers picked up 34 lbs of trash, 10 lbs of recycling, and ~3000 cigarette butts collected (almost filled a two-gallon bucket)! 

Continuing from previous cleanups lots of cigarette butts were collected, as well as vaporizers, but a car fender was definitely unique this time! 

Next month's cleanup in Foster City will be at the Marina Plaza Shopping Center on Sunday, March 19th. Address: 2920 S Norfolk St, San Mateo, CA 94403. Please register online, it saves time and paper!

This week, our ODA Oahu crew made it to Spitting Cave, a popular cliffside recreational fishing site where many lines and hooks are lost to the waters below.

The end of the day yielded 50 pounds of weight and a couple of hundred yards of fishing line. Thank you to Island Divers Hawaii and our wonderful ODA volunteers for making our oceans cleaner than before!

These guys do epic trash cleaning missions and I’m so glad we connected through @khakiandocean and I was able to join them today.

About 250kgs of human trash - bottles, bags, chip packets, shoes, fishing gear and polystyrene.

Crazy to see how much there was, especially after already cleaning some of these sections already.

Keep up the great work !!

6,"The Ocean Clean Up @theoceancleanup are working to remove plastic from the world’s oceans and has so far removed over a whopping 100,000kg of rubbish from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch! Inspired by the cause and their efforts, Airbnbs @airbnb owner Joe Gebbia donated $25 million in support. 

If you hadn’t heard, there’s a massive “island” of plastic the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean and The Ocean Clean Up is dedicated to its removal. Not all heroes wear capes 🦸‍♂️💚🌎

7,"Today's #FeelGoodFriday takes us to the  Great Pacific Garbage Patch or GPGP (located between Hawai’i and California) where a big development has been made in a non-profit's effort to clean up our oceans.

Last year we discussed Ocean Cleanup and how their ocean cleaning system, System 002, has already removed close to 440,000 pounds of plastic from the GPGP that otherwise would have remained trapped for decades or more.  Recently, the co-founder of Airbnb has just donated $25 million to support this Dutch nonprofit as they prepare to assemble and deploy the largest plastic capture system ever developed for use in the ocean - System 03. This new system cleans ten times faster than the previous system and could clean all the plastic patches of the world’s oceans with about 10-50 systems!  2023 is shaping up to be a great year in the fight against plastic pollution!

8,"We wanted to share with you some happy eco news! We know the news can be overwhelming with lots of terrible things happening, so we wanted to take a moment to celebrate something positive and feel-good.

The Ocean Cleanup is doing amazing work removing plastic pollution from the ocean. Last summer System 002 alone completed 61 extractions of a total of 194,092kg of plastic out of the ocean, and is now on a well-deserved winter break until March 2023 for maintenance.

At PurePods we believe every bit of plastic waste counts, which is why our PurePods water filters use 60% less plastic than competitors, and our cartridge is reusable!

9,"Thank you to the 96 volunteers, who cleaned the beach, streets, parking areas, pier, and even some of the golf course last Saturday at Sharp Park, Pacifica, CA! Woot woot! 

Huge thanks to the students from Saint Francis High School who joined fellow volunteers to remove 1085 Cigarette Filter (350 from the Pier), 227 pounds of trash including three battered, beat-up tires that washed up on the beach, and 125 recyclable materials.

A bucket of plastic film pieces was recovered from the beach. Enough plastic netting was picked out of the sand in the picnic area to fill a 5-gallon bucket.  It was clearly residue left behind from sod that was installed years and years ago and now uncovered from the strong waves of the past storms.

Volunteers from St. Francis High School included club members from BRIC Brothers, BRIC Sisters, the ocean club, and the environmental club. Big thanks to Tiffany (wearing the yellow jacket in the first photo) who catalyzed these students to join us, it's a perfect example of how one person can create a huge difference!

As a National Finalist for @australia_galaxy_pageants I had so much fun continuing my volunteer work to clean up our beaches with this local Northern Beaches organisation. 

So many people coming together to pick up microplastics from the shore, count and survey them. Microplastics are tiny plastic particles (a breakdown of larger plastics) that we and creatures end up ingesting which can be harmful. Today, the crew collected 3kgs of microplastics. 

Pittwater Eco Adventures run school workshops to educate kids - here are some displays of the categories of plastic, as well as a demonstration of how plastic bottle caps can be recycled and repurposed into other products like a key chain!!

15,"The Ocean Cleanup has now officially removed more than 100,000 kg of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP).

Since deployment in August 2021, System 002 (or “Jenny”) has now collected 101,353 kg of plastic over 45 extractions, sweeping an area of ocean of over 3000km2 – comparable to the size of Luxembourg or Rhode Island. Added to the 7,173 kg of plastic captured by our previous prototype systems, The Ocean Cleanup has now collected 108,526 kg of plastic from the GPGP – more than the combined weight of two and a half Boeing 737-800s, or the dry weight of a space shuttle!

16,"During this month's cleanup at Esplanade, a total of 17 volunteers joined PBC captains, including a couple high schoolers training to be junior site captains! It was a successful day even though there were high tide and king tide conditions which made it unsafe to go down to the beach. So instead, volunteers focused their efforts on the streets and in the neighborhood.

Volunteers collected 75.5 pounds of garbage which is an average of about 4.5 pounds of trash per person! Additionally, 11 pounds of recycling and 742 cigarette butts. Wowza!

Thank you so much to everyone who participated in this month's cleanup, we can’t wait to see you at our next one!

Clean Up No. 53
Location: Pantai Taman Gelora
Date:  23.1.2023 

Types of trash collected: 
• Mostly single-use plastic bags
• Used diapers
• Rope
• Clothes
• Canned drinks 

Weight of trash :  37.71 kg 

Number of heroes : 10
• 6 adults 
• 4 kids
(And 2 adult runners helped us transport the trash at the end)
Thank you to all volunteers 🙌🙏💛 

Sponsors : 
• Jue Ahmad & family : Thank you for the used sacks/gunny bags
• Private contractors engaged to clean the park : we appreciate the massive bin to dispose of the trash collected 

We were fortunate the weather cleared up for our Chinese New Year beach clean up at Taman Gelora. This was our first attempt at a clean up here, and certainly will not be our last! The monsoon brought lots of single use plastic bags which were caught on the mangrove plants. 

We were joined by regular and new volunteers. It is always lovely meeting people who share our views on caring for the environment. 

As it is Chinese New Year, every volunteer received a mandarin as a  treat 🍊🍊 Gong Xi Gong Xi and we appreciate all of you! 

There is still a lot more plastic trash to clean up at Pantai Taman Gelora, and we hope to do this on another day. If you regularly use the park, do check out the beach area. We hope to organise another clean up here and could do with more help. 

Our events are run completely by volunteers. If you would like to volunteer at our next clean up, look out for updates on our IG or FB page. If you would like to sponsor used bags/sacks/pickers/tshirts/stationery (or anything else which may aid our clean ups and our educational Kids Programme), please send us a message. Thank you 🙏🙂

24,"Disabled beach cleanup. If I can, we all can. I spent 2 hours collecting all this off a 5km stretch of beach. It’s almost impossible for me to walk in soft sand due to my ankle and knee injuries and pain but I just couldn’t drive past it. Spent the next 24 hours off my feet because of the pain I put myself through. There’s probably a km of ropes, 1000’s of small pieces of micro plastics, 15 floats, 30 glass and plastic bottles. Around 100 plastic bags and some metal objects. Some timber beams and plenty of smaller pieces. Estimating about 200kgs. The biggest issue here is that I take it off the beach but as there’s no proper way of recycling all this plastic in year 2023, it ends up in landfill. It breaks my heart to know we produce so much of this awful single use plastic that I’m just having it moved to another place for it to continue being the planet’s problem. Manufacturing of all plastic products must have an ethical disposal or recycling procedure if we’re to continue consuming and disposing of this stuff. We’ve trashed the planet so badly in just the last 100 years it’s frightening what our legacy is for the next generations and the health of our oceans and land environments. I’ve been cleaning up beaches/parks/ bush for a very long time and it’s getting worse. Let’s do better and if something doesn’t belong in nature, remove it because the litterer won’t. ✌🏼🌏

Hey ocean lovers! These storms are rad, and there’s so many waves to catch. Please consider picking up trash for just 15 minutes after surfing. I collected 15 pounds of trash that quickly. Lower tides are best. Let’s catch this crap before it all goes back into the ocean. 

On that note, how about these corporations making millions every quarter be responsible for their garbage reclamation?!? France is leading the way. Let’s move U.S.!

If you would like to volunteer at our next clean up, look out for updates on our IG or FB page. If you would like to sponsor used bags/sacks, pickers or tshirts for our volunteers (or anything else which may aid our clean ups), do drop us a message. Thank you 🙏

36,"2022 was an incredible year and despite severe floods in KZN and another year impacted by COVID not only can we say we made it, but we also managed to achieve alot to be proud of. 

Our final newsletter of 2022 covered our highlights for last year one of which was the Umhlanga River blockage in January. 

After the storms and heavy rains earlier in January, we took to social media to show the extent of damage in the Umhlanga River where we quickly deployed a team of 20 staff. 

To paint a picture, the plastic ‘blockage’ was approximately 3 meters deep and 70m upstream, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of kgs of plastic pollution.

What followed was a spectacular show of teamwork, with many organisations and individuals from around the world rallying together to remedy this bad situation!

A significant R200 000 was raised and allowed us to expand our team to 20 and deploy a TLB, as well as tractors and trailers (thanks to local farmer Rob West).

It was a tremendous feat due to our communities support and belief we were able to tackle this environmental disaster and cleared a massive 150 000kgs of waste.

37,"A hodgepodge of mini cleanups today… First stop, Humarock Beach parking lot, mostly doggy doodoo bags dropped by dodos. 

Next, the rear of the former Bank of America building on Front Street; the slow decay has accelerated and the graffiti artists are tagging it — This needs to be cleaned up. We removed the broken glass from the scene but this mess requires professional help. The deteriorating building is situated on the estuary which forms where Satuit Brook meets the Atlantic Ocean.

Last stop: Greenbush... We tidied up the path between New Driftway and Ford Place. Many nips, some fast food service, and more graffiti, this time a giant black and red caterpillar. The black body looks to be covering up writing. I think a coat of paint colored to match the wall is needed to discourage further artful contributions. The graffiti is a disturbing trend, keeping in mind the Broken Windows Theory which states that when low level crimes like vandalism are ignored, higher level and more serious crimes begin to occur.

Today’s total weight: 4.5 pounds
Number of nip bottles collected: 11

38,"In December, a team of staff and guests removed 376 kg of plastic debris from the beaches of St Francois Island! 💪🏼

Unfortunately, this represents only a year of debris accumulation on only half the island which gives insight to just how much plastic pollution affects these remote oceanic atolls. 

A massive well done to:

39,"Museum Beach was the focus of our efforts today. The storm surge swept in loads of marine debris: nylon rope, styrofoam bits, bottle caps, the omnipresent alcohol containers, and our cute new friend, a Barbie Chelsea Color Reveal doll! She lost her hairpiece, her skirt, and her shoes in the storm, but she loves her new shovel. 

In addition to the debris that surged in, Museum Beach has a serious problem with doggie doodoo bags. I hate to use a cutesy name for this disgusting item that dog owners seem compelled to toss in any direction in this town. One true nut job in the Museum Beach area has a penchant for flinging their doggie doodoo bags *at* the dumpster belonging to Scituate Yacht Club. They don’t even bother to throw the bags into the dumpster, they pile them up beside it. Then let us note the numerous piles of doggie doodoo that are left on the beach outside of bags. 

The debris that we cleaned up today weighed 11 pounds. We also moved an orange kayak that some selfish and uncaring soul had left overturned on the beachgrass. The lack of couth is bewildering.

NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN FOR AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY TO CURB PLASTIC POLLUTION ♻️
In March 2022 the  United Nations began negotiations on an international treaty to curb plastic pollution, these should conclude in 2023.

54 NEW SPECIES OF SHARKS GIVEN LEGAL PROTECTIONS🦈
CoP19 resulted in expansion of protection for around 90% of shark and ray species. 

DEEP SEA MINING HALTED 🌊⛏️
Multiple nations spoke out, halting the further development of the deep sea mining industry

THE GREEN SHIPPING INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED 
In November The Green shipping challenge launched. Detailing the decarbonisation of an industry responsible for 3% of global emissions.

Finally, some milestones that have increased since we last reported them in these posts!

OVER 2M kg OF PLASTIC REMOVED FROM THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH 🗑️🌊
As of today, the ocean cleanup project has removed 193,826 kg of plastic from the Great Pacific garbage patch. 

OVER 190 COUNTRIES HAVE PLEDGED THE 30X30 INITIATIVE ⛰️🌊
While the number of countries which have pledged to protect 30% of their land and oceans by 2030 is up to 112.

Whilst a lot has been done to help our oceans this year, we still have a long way to go. Join us as we fight for our planet, and tell the stories that bring us ocean optimism in the coming year! 🌏🌊💪🏻"

After 61 extractions and 194,092 kg of plastic out of the ocean, their System 002 is going on winter break. 2022 in numbers:

- 8 trips into the Great Pacific Garbage Patch on cleaning operations
- Over 150 days at sea (including transit)
- 153,000 kg of plastic removed from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
- 4 consecutive trips with catch totals over 25,000 kg
- 99.9% of catch comprising only plastic

""As we enter winter, it is time to bring our system back to port for scheduled evaluation and upgrades as part of the ongoing transition to the larger and more efficient System 03. We are scheduled to head back out to restart cleaning the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in March 2023.""

""The cleanup has been a monumental effort from our team on the ground. They have worked tirelessly in challenging and ever changing conditions and their commitment to cleaning as much waste as possible from that estuary and surrounding coastline has been impressive. 

We have formed a great relationship with the eThekwini Parks Department and this project would not have been possible without having them at our side. They committed themselves 100% and have not let us down one bit and we look forward to future collaborations with their department.

49,First time dealing with a rain event and they stopped 35000 lbs of waste from entering the ocean near LA. This group has also been tackling the great pacific garbage patch and kicking ass.  They need support even if it's just cheering them on.  #oceancleanup #support
50,"Much of the plastic waste that enters our oceans is picked up by circulating ocean currents known as gyres. Waste from the US  and Japan gets sucked into the Great Garbage Patch, an area of the Pacific between the US and Japan. The ‘Patch’ covers some 1.6 million square kilometers and contains around 100 million kilograms of plastic.

@TheOceanCleanup is a non-profit organization that wants to remove 90% of the Patch’s floating plastic by 2040. Its net-based System 002 has already removed more than 100,000kg of plastic from the patch. Now, the organization is working on System 003 and based on a recently-released concept video, it looks pretty awesome.

System 003 will use drones to identify waste hotspots and direct the three-ship net system to the location. Two ships will tow a massive 1,600-meter wide and four-meter deep screening system between them. The screening system funnels plastic waste into a central net. When full, the team empty the net onto a third boat, where the plastic is sorted and stored in onboard shipping containers for subsequent recycling. The slow towing speed of the system (0.75m/s) should allow most marine life to avoid being caught up (though I do wonder what will happen to jellyfish).

The Ocean Cleanup plans to create a fleet of ten System 003 machines in the coming months. You can follow their progress on Twitter and Instagram.

On #worldcleanupday2022 we were engaged by @dhlexpresspakistan and @hapaglloydag to clean up a portion of #turtlebeach.

A HUGE thank you to @rlccpk for providing upcycled block printed bags made out of newspaper! And also to CEO RLCC Somayeh Bardai for giving a talk on waste management while @ahshabbar was way.

Together, we ended up picking up 714 kg of waste. Out of which 250 kg was #plastic, 22 kg was #paper, 18 kg was tetrapak, 26 kg was #glass, 53 kg was #cloth and a whopping (yet not surprising) 66 kg was #shoes (Yes. Shoes. 545 pieces to be exact!) with the rest being landfill trash.

We need to keep in mind that beaches across #Pakistan are some of the dirtiest in the world. So, we want to thank HL, and DHL deeply for their efforts to clean up!

Thank you to everyone who joined an organized cleanup, did their own cleanup, restored a native habitat, supported, or attended our 25th anniversary of the California Coastal Cleanup Day! 

Our results in these photos, but statewide, more than 27,000 volunteers helped in the effort. (With 60 percent of cleanup sites reporting, the count stands at 27,185 volunteers.) Those volunteers picked up 220,861 pounds of trash and an additional 29,702 pounds of recyclable materials — for a total of 250,563 pounds or 125 tons. Impressive!

See you next September for the next CCCD, but remember any day can be a cleanup day here in California, or anywhere!

united by blue is an organization focused on both cleaning up the environment while reusing waste and recyclables. As a certified B Corporation and Climate Neutral Certified, they remove 1lb of trash removed for every product sold - with over 4 million pounds reclaimed so far - while organizing high yielding community cleanup events. They offer men's swim trunks with 100% recycled polyester, bikini bottoms having 88% recycled material, hats made from 100% organic cotton, and many more. This company is approaching sustainable fashion on multiple fronts, check out united by blue for your swim wear needs!

Next we have another product for the babies - a white swan toy car from Nature Baby. Made with solid wood and water-based eco-friendly paint, this is a perfect first toy for the little ones. Nature Baby also offers organic, chemical free cotton and merino wool clothing. This is another sustainable baby clothing and toy store!

Another swim and lounge wear brand is Vitamin A who, over a 10 year period, analyzed their supply chain in order to procure suppliers for creating their own swimwear fabric made from recycled materials. This process saves water during production, diverts waste from landfills and the ocean, reduces emissions and saves many kWh of energy - all stats which are provided on their website. Vitamin A also donates a portion of their sales to multiple organizations protecting our oceans. Another great swim and lounge wear brand!

Come and join a beach clean!
It’s good for the planet and your mental health - it’s a win-win!
So far this year my wonderful group of volunteers have collected a staggering amount of rubbish from our local beaches.
194.8 kg of general waste and 61kg of mixed recycling, cans, glass, plastic bottles, metal and wood. This doesn’t even include the very large pieces of metal and plastic which I am unable to weigh. 

At One Bag Beach Clean we work alongside many other local community groups and businesses down here in Cornwall. SO, a big shout out to all you amazing people out there, you know who you are! Together we really can make a difference.

As you can see, our K59 beach cleanups were extremely productive, up to 800 lbs of trash or more. And that's 100% due to the enthusiasm and hard work of the local surfers, photographers, fisherman, and other volunteers who put in the sweat.

As well as our other more permanent sites, our teams are still hard at work in the Ohlanga Estuary where we have increased our staff from 11 to 20 to take advantage of the low water levels, which have made a lot of areas more accessible. We can now clear a lot more of the plastic and prevent it from entering our oceans. 

As of yesterday afternoon, in the Ohlanga Estuary alone the team has cleared 1330 black bags for landfill and 920kgs of recyclables. An absolutely incredible effort!

After this plastic bag shred I got handfuls of small pieces of plastic and band-aids - some snatched out of fish mouths :( After photographing those gorgeous jellies the other day, I thought the clear plastic bags were jellies until i got up close. 
.
Tuesday musings. Scientists estimate that more than 11 million metric tons of plastic enters the oceans **every year** And to answer the big question, yes, you picking up that one shred does make a difference - to the turtle or fish that won't eat it now. (and. um hypothetically, since there are over 7.8 billion people 3 lbs per person per year would knock that one out ;) )

67,"Swim For Change 🏊‍♂️ 

After nearly 18 months out of action due to over training, operations, covid and mental health, I am really happy to announce a fresh start to the relaunch of my swim campaigns and training for the English Channel swim with @empowerplastic.

Last year through the swim campaigns I managed to raise a total of £2127, this money was directly spent on certified clean up operations around the world which you can see at @oneglobalocean, recovering a total of 3500kg of ocean plastic.

The swim project will be spread over a two or three year period (not one!) with the aim this time on raising awareness through different campaigns here in North Wales, and in turn raising more money to help support those most in need around the world.

Thanks for all your support so far, it all helps 🙏

68,"🌎”The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” - Robert Swan 🌍 Today, our students and staff worked together to ✨dive and snorkel with a purpose!✨ In collaboration with @sendabagpickupabag, we collected several bags of trash 🚮 that have accumulated at a couple of our sites since hurricane Fiona.🌀 It was gratifying to leave the sites better than we found them and it’s always inspiring to witness the profound impact we have when we work together. 🤝 Congrats to Waterfront Assistant Conrad who also removed two highly invasive lionfish, one of which is a season record by weight (475g 1.04lbs 32cm)! 🎉 This excursion was a tremendous success, stay tuned for an action-packed video and more reef clean up opportunities!

69,"Had the opportunity to participate in a beach cleanup event at the beaches I now call home in Dana Point. Together with @standuptotrash and other volunteers we removed 175.45 lbs of trash. Yesterday was America Recycling Day and I am glad I was able to celebrate by participating in and spreading awareness for protection of our oceans through recycling programs. It is very important to me to preserve these beautiful places and promote the health of the ocean and the environment for those today and generations to come. I am excited to continue to participate in events like this in my area and encourage others to do the same. Every action no matter how small can make a difference

70,"9th cleanup at Honokohau Harbor & counting!

We removed nearly 3,500 pounds of debris and 46 tires, for a grand total of 6,720 pounds.  That’s over 3 tons!!

In a collection of PVC tubing, pipes, carpets, dive masks, fishing poles, some kind of trap cages, lead fishing weights, mono-filament line, and of course the ubiquitous tires, our 50 volunteers absolutely blew this cleanup out of the park!

71,"Beach Clean Up - Clean Up No. 50
Kolaborasi Trash Hero Kuantan & MISA (UIA) 
Lokasi: Pantai Teluk Cempedak
Tarikh: 13.11.2022 

Jenis sampah yang dikutip: 
• Kebanyakkan sampah piknik yang ditinggalkan pengunjung (bekas McD, Starbucks, KFC)
• Pelitup muka
• Kotak rokok dan puntung rokok
• Beg plastik 
• Polisterin 

Berat sampah yang dikutip: Anggaran 37 kg 

Bilangan wira: 11 dewasa 

Kami amat bersyukur cuaca baik pada pagi clean up walaupun dah berhari-hari hujan di Kuantan. Ramai saja pengunjung ke Pantai Teluk Cempedak. Semuanya dah sampai awal pagi lagi. Ada yang siap bercamping malam juga. 

Abang² dan Kakak² Alam Flora pun dah sampai cukup awal. Sampah² piknik yang dikutip baru lagi - terbiar oleh pengunjung yang tidak bertanggungjawab. Monyet² pun keluar pagi² nak kacau² sampah tu sebab semua bekas makanan dan minuman dengan makanan separuh dimakan tu dibiar begitu saja. 

Walaupun bukan sampah kita, sama² kita tolong bersihkan area pantai (dari jambatan Bay 2 sehingga ke @hyattregencykuantanresort) dan kawasan² awam serta jalan² berdekatan. 

Terima kasih kepada semua sukarelawan yang turut serta pada hari Ahad lalu, pelajar² dari @misaiiumk dan pihak Alam Flora yang telah menolong dengan pengangkutan beg² sampah dalam lori mereka 🙏💛 

Jika anda ingin turut serta dalam sesi gotong-royong kami, sila pantau FB dan IG Trash Hero Kuantan untuk butir² lanjut. 

Jika anda ingin mendermakan peralatan seperti penyepit sampah ('pickers') / guni sampah / tshirt untuk sukarelawan / alat tulis untuk Kids Program (atau apa² yang akan membantu aktiviti² Trash Hero Kuantan) sila DM kami di sini. 

Segala pertolongan amat dialu-alukan. 
Dan kalau boleh, tolong share post ini.
Terima kasih 🙏💛

In total, 75kg of marine litter was collected as well as 3kg of land litter consisting mainly of cigarette butts. Some waste could have been avoided by adopting more responsible behavior!

A big THANKS to the entire team of divers from the Club d'Exploration Sous-Marine de Monaco for their permanent involvement and to the other volunteers who took part in this operation.
 
THANK YOU also to the Société Monégasque d'Assainissement (@greenmonaco_by_sma ) for providing the waste collection bin and the scale as well as for the presence of the jet-ski to collect the bags brought back by the divers.

109,"At 25 July 2022 the operation in the Pacific Ocean reached an exciting
milestone: The Ocean Cleanup has now officially removed more than 100,000 kg
of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP).

Since deployment in August 2021, System 002 (or ""Jenny"") has now collected
101,353 kg of plastic over 45 extractions, sweeping an area of ocean of over
3000km2 - comparable to the size of Luxembourg or Rhode Island. Added to the
7,173 kg of plastic captured by the previous prototype systems, The Ocean
Cleanup has now collected 108,526 kg of plastic from the GPGP - more than
the combined weight of two and a half Boeing 737-800s, or the dry weight of
a space shuttle!

Now the technology is validated, and is ready to move on to the new and
expanded System 03, which is expected to capture plastic at a rate
potentially 10 times higher than System 002 through a combination of
increased size, improved efficiency, and increased uptime. Our transition to
System 03 is starting soon.

Some #3d insights:

As i describes in my last post, it was quite a challenge to get the
Cloth-Rigid body simulation working.

But to fill up the whole retention zone with thousands of plastic waste
parts was on antoher level.

I actually think i can proudly say i never simulated a larger setup than
this one.

Super proud i was able to throw some physix ropes in there too!

Watch out for them! ;-)

Thank you for having lent us your weighing scales to weigh the trash collected and also for allowing us to use your bin area & to Pn. Ain for getting the word out to all the staff volunteers today. 

Fabulous volunteers and Mandurah Hotel staff joined the clean up at Beserah Beach today. There was a lot of plastic waste and picnic waste left on the beach. Also a lot of old trash washed in by the tide. 

A couple of kids (a 4 year old and a toddler) saw us cleaning and walked up to us with their father in tow to help 🥰👍. If they can do it, you can too!

Together, we can make a difference! 

If you would like to volunteer at our next clean up, look out for updates on our IG or FB page. If you would like to sponsor bags, pickers or tshirts for our volunteers (or anything else which may aid our clean ups), please drop us a message. Thank you 🙏

113,"The Ocean Cleanup: tecnología de limpieza marina 🚯🌊

The Ocean Cleanup ha realizado 2 limpiezas marinas, es por eso que para librar al océano de su mayor masa de contaminación, la organización lanza su tercera y más eficiente tecnología de limpieza marina. 

El Gran Parche de Basura del Pacífico (GPGP por sus siglas en inglés) es una gigantesca masa de plástico, redes de pesca y otros desechos no biodegradables fabricados por el hombre que se extiende por el océano entre California y Hawai. Se calcula que su tamaño total es de 1.6 millones de km2 en todo el Océano Pacífico y lleva décadas causando estragos en animales marinos como ballenas, delfines, tortugas, mantas y otros peces. 

Hasta hoy, no ha sido fácil detener su crecimiento, ya que cada año se vierten unos 12 millones de toneladas de plástico en los océanos.

En julio de este año, The Ocean Cleanup informó de que ya habían recogido 108 mil 526 kg de plástico del GPGP utilizando el Sistema 002, esto es aún más que el peso combinado de 2.5 aviones Boeing 737.

Our team of 8 collected 12.5kg of trash including 74 lids, 577 pieces of plastic remnants, some fishing equipment, boat parts and some microplastics across 800mtrs of beach! Once again hatched turtle eggs were found on this beach which ultimately is why we think it's important to cleanup our beaches.

All data will be uploaded to @tangaroablue 's Australian Marine Debris Initiative and microplastics (more than 5mm in size) sent to @ausmap_au

137,"This past June we had the absolute pleasure of teaming up with @townlinehomes to complete a shoreline cleanup project, resulting in close to 7,000kgs of debris being removed from over 42km of shoreline.

Townline reached out to us interested in getting involved in the restoration of our coastal habitats, with the intention of promoting awareness within their company AND being an industry leader.

The founder of Townline has a lifelong relationship with the Ocean through surfing and windsurfing. He has spent his life enjoying the magic the Ocean offers and as their company gets further into its environmental responsibility journey, RCRS seemed like a perfect fit.

This development company has some brilliant initiatives coming down the pipe to help deal with their construction waste. This shoreline project was to put forth resources toward professionals (us) to have an immediate impact. 

For one day of fieldwork, 25 employees joined our crews to learn about the marine debris problem we face and get firsthand experience in the work required to tackle it. 

It was a blast to witness the changes in some of these folks as they experienced the mess we see every day and to hear all the banter of actions they are all planning to take into their lives.

This inspiration for change is why Rugged Coast does what we do, aside from the obvious drive to better our marine environment of course 😉

Thank you Townline!!

But I like to see the beauty in all things, and plastic is no exception.
Which is why I enjoy the process of turning all of this into works of art.

While we collect debris on every dive, we also organize and support multiple large scale clean up dives each year.  These efforts regularly result in 500-1000 pounds of debris removed on each clean up.  In 2022, we have received a grant from PADI AWARE to support and enhance these clean ups. 

Find out more about our large scale clean ups below.

Des Moines Marina 
Each year for International Coastal Clean Up Day, we partner with SR3, the City of Des Moines, Des Moines Marina, MaST Aquarium and Washington Scuba Alliance to clean the Des Moines pier area around the existing tire reefs.  We have been working this project for 3-4 years and we still remove 500-1000 pounds of debris each year. 

Seacrest Pier
We work in partnership with Seattle Parks and Recreation and King County Marine Division (operator of the West Seattle Water Taxi) to clean under the Seacrest Pier. 
On our initial clean at this pier, we removed over 500 pounds of debris from this site with 10-12 divers. Part of this debris volume was over 600 squid jigs on this single clean up. 

Seattle Dive Tours is a 100% PADI Aware, Green Star, PADI 5 Star Dive Resort and a 1% for the Planet and Green Fins member.

There are over 2,000 species that are only found in one of the Pacific island countries, and almost half of those are Threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) 🐠🐟

Protecting marine environments and species starts on land. Preventing pollution and restoring protective ecosystems is something we can all do in our community spaces ♻️

When you use eco-friendly products, separate waste, buy local goods, and ensure a balance between development and conservation, you are saving the ocean by limiting the impact we all individually have on it 🌱

We are also trying to do our part, therefore every candle from our Ocean collection cleans 1 kg of plastic out of the rivers and prevents this plastic from entering the ocean 💙

152,"Beach Clean Up - Clean Up No. 46
Lokasi: Pantai Pelindung
Tarikh: 20.8.2022 

Sampah yang dikutip: 
Kebanyakkan sampah adalah botol² plastik sekali guna, botol gelas, bekas minuman & makanan plastik, bungkusan makanan, dan lampin pakai buang bayi 

Berat sampah yang dikutip: 21.91 kg 

Bilangan wira: 3
•2 dewasa
•1 kanak-kanak 

Malangnya hujan lebat hari ini di sekitar Beserah dan clean up hampir² dibatalkan. Tetapi bila dah sampai di lokasi, hujan renyai² saja jadi sukarelawan bertiga pun teruskan saja dengan Merdeka beach clean up. Clean up pun terpaksa dipendekkan kerana dah nak hujan di lokasi. 

Kebanyakkan sampah adalah sampah piknik yg dibuang oleh orang² yg tidak bertanggungjawab. Kawasan ini tiada tong sampah. Jadi bawa pulanglah sampah anda.  

Masih ada sampah plastik (bekas makanan/minuman plastik, lampin bayi dll.) yg dibakar dijumpai di pantai. Ramai orang tidak peka langsung berkenaan bahayanya membakar plastik. 

Pembakaran plastik melepaskan gas² toksik seperti dioksin, furans, merkuri dll. ke dalam atmosfera dan ini sangat merbahaya kepada kesihatan manusia dan haiwan.

Lampin bayi juga mengandungi plastik. Janganlah bakar. Buang di tempat sepatutnya. Takkan biar di pantai macam tu saja. Malulah ibu bapa yg buang diapers anak² di pantai. Bertanggungjawablah sikit. 

Kami bersih. Kami didik. Kami ubah. 

Be a Trash Hero. 
Make a difference 💛

155,"Ever wondered why a hammerhead shark’s head is shaped so strangely? 
 
Scientists have recently discovered that the unique hammer shape improves these sharks’ vision making them excellent hunters!
 
A hammerhead shark can reach up to 20 ft in length and weigh up to 1,000 pounds!
 
Want to know what else is unique about these blockheaded sharks?
 
Great Hammerheads like to swim sideways
Scalloped Hammerheads will actually sunbathe and get a tan! 
But the Bonnethead species wins the prize for strange traits. In Nebraska, a female Bonnethead had a virgin birth. The staff was baffled because the shark tank only housed females and none of them had seen a male in three years.

What a beautiful way to celebrate the anniversary of when we began construction of our recycling center last year.

It was a very far figure, but we have achieved it. Now, we won't stop until we double it. New projects are on the way, and hopefully this figure will be completely ridiculous in our near future.

162,"Manatees are known as sea cows. This name is apt due to their large bodies, slow lolling movements, and their propensity for getting eaten by other animals. Despite their nickname, they are more closely related to the elephant.

Manatees can grow up to 11 feet long and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. With all that weight, comes a lot of food. They eat 1/10th of their body weight a day.

Even though they have the lowest brain-to-body ratios the manatees are as adept at experimental tasks as dolphins, one of the smartest animals on the planet.

As herbivores manatees graze on all kinds of aquatic vegetation. Plastic bags and 6-pack holders are especially dangerous to the sea cows. There have been manatees found with dozens of plastic bags in their stomach which causes the mammal to die of starvation. It’s important for all of our marine friends that we try and keep plastic out of our waters. Now more than ever it is easier to avoid single-use plastics. Do it for the manatees.

182,"The Ocean Cleanup Project has reached an exciting milestone - they have officially removed over 100,000 kg of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch! Since the deployment of System 002 (aka “Jenny”) almost a year ago, they have collected 101,353 kg of plastic over 45 extractions.

The group has covered an area of the ocean over 3,000 km2, which is comparable to the size of Luxembourg. They reported that the weight of all the trash collected amounts to more than two and a half Boeing 737-800s combined!

The 100,000 kg milestone is a major marker of success for a project that has been in the works for the past decade, but there is still a long way to go. “If we repeat this 100,000 kg haul 1,000 times, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch will be gone,” wrote The Ocean Cleanup. 

However, System 002 is still an experimental system. And now that their technology has proved a success, they are ready to move on to the new System 03 which is expected to capture plastic at a rate potentially 10 times higher!

BUT that's only 1/1000th of the plastic that makes up the infamous garbage patch. ⁠

We can't drown our plastic problem, we can't incinerate it, and we can't recycle our way out of it either. The only option is LESS PLASTIC."

Since deployment in August 2021, System 002 has now collected 101,353 kg of plastic over 45 extractions, sweeping an area of the ocean of over 3,000 km2 – comparable to the size of Luxembourg. 

According to their 2018 study which mapped the patch, the total amount of accumulated plastic is 79,000,000 kg, or 100,000,000 kg if they include the Outer GPGP. Thus, if they repeat the 100,000 kg haul 1,000 times – the Great Pacific Garbage Patch will be gone.

Replacing #plastic bags with #totes is a super easy #greenswap you can do to help the #Earth (and feel happy while grocery shopping)...⁠
⁠
These #totebags were #handdrawn with #love by me, and this weekend, for every tote purchased, 1 kg of plastic (or 50 plastic bottles!) will be recovered and recycled into a closed loop supply chain by @plasticbank, removing this plastic from our #oceans forever.⁠
⁠
I'm curious which design is your favorite, or maybe you just have to get all 3! Go for it with #joy -- any totes you order (or anything else on my stores for that matter) will be sustainably printed just for you with natural/recycled materials in @teemillstore's renewable-energy factory. Everything is #ethically-sourced and washable with no microplastics going back into our oceans.⁠

204,"Did you know that seals evolved from land-based bears or otter-like creatures?

Nowadays seals spend the majority of their life in the water. They can hold their breath for up to 2 hours and even sleep in the water. The only time you’ll see one come to shore is if they are escaping predators, mating, giving birth, or to moult.

There are 33 species of seals in the world. The smallest is the Galapagos Fur Seal weighing less than 100 pounds. The largest is the Elephant Seal which can weigh almost 9,000 pounds!

They seem like they are playful creatures, but they actually can be quite aggressive and territorial. In New Zealand, a local Elephant Seal named Homer would cause havoc around town by tipping over parked cars. His aggressive rubbing on the vehicles was chalked up to just some misguided sexual advances.

Seals were hunted for years before they became highly protected mammals in most parts of the world. Now seals face a different foe, plastic. Seals unknowingly ingest microplastic that pollutes our oceans. Plastic increases their chance of disease and affects their reproduction. After ingesting enough of it they can suffer for months before passing away. 

The time to do something about our plastic use started decades ago. Now though it is becoming easier and easier to find safe plastic alternatives.

Double tap if you want to save the seals. You can also follow @ekonova_official for more interesting animal facts."
205,"See what our PMDP staff have been up to! On day four of their marine debris cleanup journey, they were able to survey new reefs not yet charted by NOAA. They then removed 7,090 lbs of marine debris from these reefs. That’s making history and a difference. Way to go team!

But experts say that the volume could be slashed significantly if we reduce the growth of virgin plastic production, improve waste collection systems across the globe, and invest in the creation of plastic materials that are easier to recycle. ♻️

223,"The day’s amazing cleanup crew! Awesome dives protecting the ocean with these environmental stewards. Although there’s still plenty of fishing line and marine debris to still remove down there, this incredible team was able clean up almost 150lbs of marine debris (146lbs to be exact) off the living reef at #KukuiulaHarbor. So many of us utilize that harbor and the ocean in general (many for their own livelihoods), and the more people take from nature, we believe the more should be put back into nature. Such is why we are so grateful for organizations like @kauaioceanawareness @coordenadasremotas and @seasportdivers that see the value in protecting the natural resources and the organisms that live in them. #Sustainability (according to Webster) means: of, relating to, or being a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged. We can all make sustainable choices in our everyday actions to live with rather than above nature. We have our ancestors to thank for the natural resources we still get to enjoy today, so what will future generations thank us for when we are considered the ancestors? #Hoomalukekai #TakeCareOfNatureAndItWillTakeCareOfYou

Both the female and male walruses have tusks. They use them to crawl up on the ice and defend themselves against predators and other walruses.
 
Walruses are very social creatures and can amass in the 1000s during mating season. They are very susceptible to disturbance and noise which can cause walrus to stampede back to the water. Definitely wouldn’t want to get in the way of that charge, especially considering that a walrus can match the running speed of a human! 
 
Climate change is the biggest threat to walruses because as the ice melts they are losing their habitat. Surprisingly plastic pollution is being used to save these creatures. Scientists are reclaiming debris from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and using it as artificial ice flows for walruses, seals, and polar bears.
 
While we are all for creative uses for our ocean plastic pollution, that doesn’t mean that the problem is solved. Plastic pollution still causes a heavy threat to most marine life. Please avoid the use of single-use plastics and recycle whenever possible.
 
What is the most creative use of recycled materials you have ever seen?

228,"We have some BIG news!!! 

We have officially partnered with @4ocean to become a certified clean up partner!! 🌊🌊

What does this mean? It means that we have committed to pulling 10,000 pounds of trash / plastics from our oceans over the next calendar year. We aim to create as much impact as possible and this partnership allows us to do so. 

The more you support us in purchasing our products the more trash we aim to commit to cleaning up. This way not only are we using bottles in our products but extending that impact with our business partnerships as well and cleaning our oceans. 

We couldnt be more excited about this partnership!!!

237,"As we wrap up this year’s World Ocean Week, we wanted to say Mahalo Nui Loa to all the protectors of the ocean and environment everywhere! Days like #WorldOceanDay this past Wednesday at #KukuiulaHarbor remind us that although at first glance nature can look beautiful, there is usually something that can be found beneath the surface beauty that may destroy that environment over time without the proper care and mālama. We saw an overwhelming amount of fishing line underwater at the harbor cleaning up and did what we could to untangle the live corals there carefully. We ended up with a haul of almost 130lbs from this awesome cleanup with @seasportdivers, but we estimate at least another 1,000lbs of debris in the harbor exists. Disclaimer to others wanting to go clean up on their own: the tires and other man-made objects that have fixated themselves overtime into the reef and have live coral growing on them were and should always be left alone. We do what we can every day, but imagine if we all took 5-10 minutes out of our days to clean up something in nature that wasn’t ours? Remember that every day our world, ocean, and environment work for us to keep us alive. Why not return that favor? 🙏

“Lost, abandoned or otherwise discarded fishing gear impacts the global ocean, harming marine wildlife, degrading habitat, and endangering vessels and ocean-users,” says Dr. Kirsten Gilardi, director of the WHC and its Lost Fishing Gear Recovery Project.

From 2020-2021, nearly 91,000 lbs of lost fishing gear was removed off the Southern California coast via the Project. Plus, approximately 1,400 marine animals were released after being found trapped in this recovered gear.

253,"❕❗ THIS IS SO SAD 😢 🐋 💀

Recently, sperm whales have been washing up on the shores around the world. Within the last month, Israell, USA and the Philippines have had these magnificent creatures wash up on beach's. 

Each and every one has been found with different types of plastic in their stomachs, meaning that the whales can not eat. In turn starving themselves and eventually dying and washing up on beach's. 

Maddie Kaufman, program and outreach director of Debris Free Oceans said “Unfortunately, when animals consume our trash, they can’t break it down in their stomachs and they fill up and actually think they’re full, so they can end up starving.”

WHY are they having to eat our trash! WHY do we have trash in the oceans! 🤬

The images above are from Isle of Harris in the UK. The whale was found with a 100kg 'litterball' inside its stomach. This was made up of fishing nets, rope, packing straps, bags, plastic cups and more! 

From the tiniest plankton to the largest sperm whales, plastics impact nearly 700 species in the oceans of the planet. Plastic has been found in more than 60 per cent of all seabirds and in 100 per cent of sea turtles species. 🐢

259,"👉🏼 Swipe for my gorgeous pics on K’Gari (Fraser Island) over the weekend! 

🚨This is my highest level red alert for our planet.

🌏 Together with the legendary team from @zeroco.com.au - the startup helping us to ditch single use plastic - and a bunch of rad planet loving humans, we travelled to K’Gari and pulled 1,222.5 kgs of rubbish from the beach and waterways in a couple of days. It was distressing to see the huge amount in a relatively short time.

🤚🏼We sorted it by hand, and 421 kgs of high density plastic could go to ZeroCo to be remade into their “forever” bottles which are made to last, you guessed it, forever. Some of the rest could be recycled or reused by different organisations but much of what was left will go to landfill.

Here is some other info to ponder:

🥤Only 16% of our plastic recycling in Australia ACTUALLY GETS RECYCLED.

🗑 The average human goes through 3,000 plastic bottles in their lifetime. 

🐢 The flow of ocean currents, storms and floods means the coast and K’Gari cops a lot of garbage from Australia and Asia. We found a lot of plastic from Indonesia and even China. 

🏖 K’Gari translates to Paradise. And so much of it is! But it is also covered in trash and tiny bits of broken plastic. 

👎🏼 Recycling is not the answer we have been told. We have to turn this off at the source. 

✅ ZeroCo are helping solve this problem by funding large scale ocean clean-ups, remanufacturing existing plastic into their forever bottles and offering reusable and refillable pouches. It is a circular production with zero plastic waste. Plus their deliveries are carbon negative, YES NEGATIVE! (it’s all on their website).

🤙🏼 By avoiding single use plastic ZeroCo are untrashing the planet and are one of the only household and body care companies doing it this way to help us get out of this mess.

😁 So if you are not a customer, I urge you to think about becoming one. Your house, your office, your sports club.
Slide into my DM’s if you want more information or a discount code. I don’t care about gaining anything with referrals, I just saw what I saw with my own eyes and I cried so much that I want everyone to be the change we need to make.

A BIG thank you to the 60 community volunteers that joined our @inland.sea beach clean this weekend at Penrhos beach on Anglesey, recovering 82kg of plastic.

@inland.sea is the first North Wales business to take part in Plastic Free Spaces, part of the Yellow Flag Award.

The Yellow Flag Award program combines plastic offset commitments by companies through plastic credits, with plastic waste removal from our Ocean. 

The goal is to bring incentives, local awareness and education about the benefits of proper waste resource recovery and management, so that trash does not become an environmental problem.

Through the work of @oneglobalocean and our partners, we aim to engage as many businesses in North Wales in our plastic offset programme and help communities devastated by plastic waste.

So far @oneglobalocean has recovered 4,392kg of ocean plastics and marine litter, through a combination of our amazing community here in North Wales, and raising money through campaigns to support clean ups around the world to give people most in need jobs and a stable income.

Thank you 🙏🙏🙏

264,"Introducing...THE FINAL STRAW

Our brand new Ocean Saving Pale Ale and collaboration brew with @sevencleanseas. At 5% this light bodied and tropically fruity pale ale is perfect for any occasion, along with having true purpose behind its creation. 

This release is super important to all of us here at SALT, and we want to make an impact to ensure that our world is maintaining and improving its ecosystems for future generations to come. 

The Final Straw is accessible to all and available at over 500 @tescofood stores nationwide from today. Every single minute, a truck’s worth of plastic is dumped into the oceans, and by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish, scary right? 

So with every four pack sold, we’ll be funding the removal of 500g of plastic from the ocean and our goal is to aid the removal 40,000kg of plastic. Join us in our mission today and help us give “drinking like a fish” a whole new meaning!🐟🍻

Make an impact, drink The Final Straw"

269,"This morning’s beach haul. It’s crazy how much plastic waste is sitting on our beaches - you don’t even notice it until you actively start looking. 😣

We collected all this waste in about 20 minutes - plastic bottles, a lip balm tube, coffee cups, a tampon applicator, polystyrene, fishing line, goggles, a bottle cap and a huge piece of foam netting among many pieces of miscellaneous pieces of plastic. All up it probably weighed about 1kg.

Next time you’re at the beach (or anywhere!) see if you can find any little bits of plastic waste to collect. I can guarantee you’ll be astounded by the amount you find.

283,"💙Every order recovers 1kg of plastic 💙

Spread the word!!! 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼
This weekend, your order will fund the recovery of ocean-bound plastic as part of a program delivered by Plastic Bank. From discarded ghost nets to minuscule microplastics released during washing, our planet is facing a plastic crisis. 8 million plastic pieces find their way to our seas every single day. That's why our products are made from natural materials, powered by renewable energy and delivered in plastic-free packaging. And from 9am Friday to midnight Sunday this weekend, you can help us work towards a solution to plastic pollution with every order. Simply head to checkout with your order and we'll do the rest.

Why not go check out our awesome range of clothes on Instagram shop or website link in bio - easy checkout on our website and WORLDWIDE shipping!! Free standard shipping to the Uk on orders over £50, to Europe on orders over €70 and to the US on orders over $124 📦 🌍📦 Plastic free paper packaging with all orders♻️📦

284,"Let's do something about ocean plastic together this Earth Day. 

When you buy from us this weekend, your order will fund the recovery and recycling of 1kg of ocean-bound plastic through a program run by our friends at Plastic Bank. For each order we will sponsor them to recover a kilo, about the equivalent of 50 plastic bottles. You probably already know that our products are made from natural materials but design choices that stop plastic isn't enough, we want to restore and regenerate the environment and that means turning back the tide of waste from the 60% of clothing out there in the world that's made from plastic. Instead of more microplastics, we ship orders in packaging made from plants, and by placing an order from Friday to midnight Sunday, you can help us do more for our oceans.

Tap on the link in our bio to shop 1Tee1kg, starting Friday tomorrow till Sunday midnight."
285,"Even though spring is in full swing here in California, in some areas of the state rain is still a frequent occurrence. So here’s a little #MondayMotivation to go out and pick up what you can find before the next rain. Doing so will help prevent trash from entering the ocean.

Suzanne and her husband went out last week and collected over 300 cigarette butts, 29 masks, and more yuck totaling about 35 pounds in just a 1/4th of a mile. Nuts! 

Do you pass a particularly trashy area in your neighborhood? Become an Earth Hero and join our Street to Beach program, and track your trash. You’ll be contributing a citizen science database that helps inform hotspots and future plastic/trash legislation.

With the help of 30 likeminded volunteers, we removed over 3000kg of rubbish to celebrate Global Recycling Day! An epic achievement and a fun-filled adventure.

We had to use a paddle board to transport the rubbish bags from the island to the boat, due to the low tide and risk of hitting the reef. Everyone did an incredible job, and all of the plastic bottles we collected will be recycled properly. It’s a shame this has to be done, but hopefully it will raise awareness of the global plastic pollution crisis we are battling, even in paradise. Well done team 🌎

Post work #plogging today. Many people on the beach on a Friday evening. Don't leave your trash around for others. Take a bag - pick some trash - even if it isn't yours. 
Be the #change. 

Ps: Sending the plastic bottles off to be recycled tomorrow! 

Sesi plogging selepas habis kerja petang ni. Ramai jugak orang di pantai hari ni. Janganlah biar sampah anda di pantai untuk dikutip oleh orang lain. Bawalah beg - kutiplah sampah - walaupun bukan sampah anda. Bawalah perubahan.

Ps: Nak hantar semua botol plastik untuk dikitar semula esok!

308,"I'm always looking for ways to use less plastic, so I appreciate brands who make the effort. @oceanhealthsg’s Omega 3 Fish Oil 1000mg is now available in a NEW eco-friendly Refill Pack which uses 90% less plastic! 

And to celebrate this launch, I was invited for my very first seabed clean up with the awesome Ocean Health team in partnership with the equally amazing @oursingaporereefs!

I haven't got my diver's license yet but I was ready to sort out the ocean trash my team brought up, and that they did! After searching the seabed for an hour, they hauled 45 items weighing 5kg - plastic wastes, fishing line/lures/hooks, metal scraps and even a rusty fishing trap! Not at all easy in low visibility water and strong currents, but what a great team effort to protect our local marine wildlife. This is definitely something I want to be a part of more, so I'll be getting my diving licence as soon as I can, so I can be of more help!

Join us by using refill packs to reduce plastic waste! Get your Ocean Health Omega 3 Fish Oil 1000mg Refill Pack 190s exclusively at @watsonssg at $24.60 with purchase of a 2x180s Twin Pack from now till 30 Apr - check out the link in my bio.

Also, $1 will go towards supporting Our Singapore Reefs’ seabed clean up efforts so they can continue to do their awesome work to keep our coral reefs and oceans clean 🌊

310,"INSPO OF THE WEEK: @oceansole 

Let's start off with some facts.

1. 47,000 kg of flip flop waste collected each year.
2. 750,000 flip flops recycled this year.
3. 10,000 people educated.

This social enterprise is called Ocean Sole. It upcycles discarded flip flops found along beaches and waterways in Kenya, turning them into beautiful works of art.

The new pieces are then sold at local Kenyan markets and on Ocean Sole's website. 10-15% of the generated revenue goes toward conservation efforts such as beach clean ups and educational programmes.

The rest goes towards positively impacting Kenyans through direct employment, facilitating payments for educating their children, buying land, and other means.

Way to go @oceansole ! 🌎♻️🩴❤️"

Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, we are not having scheduled group clean ups. It was a solo one today. As usual, picnic goers were out at the beach. The sun was scorching after the rain yesterday. Beautiful morning. But trash filled beach sadly. Hoping all the picnic goers clear up after themselves. We can all make a difference. 

Your trash = Your responsibility

Oleh kerana kenaikkan kes COVID-19, kami tidak membuat pembersihan pantai berkumpulan. Solo clean up sahaja hari ini. Seperti biasa dah ada orang datang berkelah di pantai. Matahari dah terik selepas hujan semalam. Pagi yang cukup cantik. Tetapi pantai penuh dengan sampah. Harap² semua orang yang datang berkelah bersihlah selepas habis piknik.

322,"Wow, a welcome influx of holiday-makers to the island this week has got waste specialist staff busy!!⁠
⁠
The @fmplgilitrawangan runs operations to sort and process as much waste as possible, so it doesn't end up in the island dump.⁠
With fewer businesses and residential areas sorting their own waste, these dedicated staff often spend hours of their day selecting valuable rubbish from the dump to keep the system running smoothly. ⁠
⁠
This huge block is made of pressed PET drinks bottles weighing in at around 46-50kg each. We are now recycling around 1 tonne of rubbish every month, which gets sent to a larger facility in mainland Lombok.⁠
⁠
We can't recycle our way out of this mess that we created, but for now, we can keep cleaning the island and continue to create salaries for these guys that are working so hard!⁠

323,"„There is no such thing as away. When you throw something away, it must go somewhere.” — Annie Leonard

At least our Sana Mare clean-up teams pick up the trash that others have dumped at the beach, in the ocean or in rivers. From there we sell the recyclables to recycling companies or we dispose it in the best available way in this region.
We aim to carry out at least 200 beach and river cleanups in 2022 and collect at least 40000 kg of waste. Help us to establish this project. With little money we can achieve a lot. Until now we have collected 3,14 kg of waste per 1 € (one Euro only!!!)
By donating only 10€ per month you can remove about 31 kg of waste. Become a donor at www.sana-mare.org/spenden

Our clean-up activities are supported by our friends from @meeresschutz_org

324,"🚨🆘🚨 Every day over 80,000,000 pounds of plastic enters the ocean! 🧴🍼🌊🐬

This 55 gallon bucket is filled with over 10 pounds of PET plastic. Over 400 plastic bottles and containers, that I collected from around Laguna beach, California. 

It took hours to remove the labels, separate HDPE caps and tabs, wash them, and compact them. 

We need funding to upgrade our plastic recycling process and start building ships to remove oceanic pollution. We can’t afford to do this without everyone’s support! 

100% of the profits made on our 3D printed products goes towards purchasing machinery and equipment we desperately need! 🆘

340,"Our global network of local waste collection hubs is growing. 🎉

We are beyond excited to have partnered with vRecyle, a waste management organization in Goa!

vRecycle's model is designed to support local communities to manage their waste self-sufficient and can be replicated very easily in developing areas as it is low cost, low manpower-intensive but highly impactful.😎

Up to now, they are the most essential partner to over 25,000 homes that effectively manage their waste through them - with their facilities processing more than 3,500 kg of waste every single day.

Our aim is to recover 250 tonnes of plastic together this year and we are looking forward to every single kg of it! 🤗

I found many pieces of fishing net and most of them were wrapped in poor Acropora. 

A big piece that took me over an hour to remove was wrapped in 3 large Acropora digitifera. 

unfortunately I didn't have a camera handy, I was rather preoccupied with starting to clean up this magnificent bay crowded with ghost net.  tomorrow I will have the chance to have help and we will go scubadiving!

This is the sad reality of what Haida Gwaii and the rest of BCs prestine coastlines look.

346,"New!  Flip Flop Animals from Kenya.  Crafted of cleaned up-recycled flip flops that wash up on Kenyan beaches. 

We’ve carried these in the past, but not for years.  While an amazing cause with excellent goals of both ocean cleanup and helping people, we felt the price point was too high.  The prices are now more affordable so we are bringing them in again as a test to see if we will expand the line. 

Inspired by the toys children were making out of the flip-flop debris, entrepreneurs encouraged their mothers to collect, wash, and cut the discarded flip-flops into colourful products to sell at local Kenyan Markets as another means of income for their families.

Every day thousands of imported foam, disposable flip flops wash up on Kenyan beaches.  It is a serious problem.  This workshop arranges beach cleanups and separates and recycles the various garbage including the flip flops and styrofoam. 

The flip flops are rigorously cleaned, separated by color and then glued together.  These blocks of flip flops are then carved with knives into colorful African and ocean Animals. 

Their enterprise positively impacts over a 1,000 Kenyans through the collection of flip-flops and direct employment. 

They employ full time nearly 100 low-income Kenyans.  Their goal is to recycle over a million flip flops per year (they accomplished recycling approximately 750,000 flip flops - over 100,000 pounds in 2021). They also recycle over one ton of styrofoam collected off beaches every month, and save over five hundred trees a year - by using flip flops instead of wood. 

We will feature these in our live sale this Friday (Feb 11th) on our main facebook from 5-9pm and offer them in store. 

If they prove popular enough we will expand the line!

354,"Our activities in Tanzania will continue in 2022. We started on Janury 22nd involving kids and young adults from the local eco-jogging club and the local boxing club.

Here is what our clean-up coordinator Olarip Tomito says about the event:

""The kickoff for our 2022 event was one of a kind and was conducted in one of the unique beaches in Dar es Salaam. Despite the fact that it was drizzling but it never stopped us from what we planned for the day. As part of their Saturday plogging routine we started doing light warm-ups accompanied with music. Thereafter we started doing plogging (jogging with picking wastes) on the way to Kichangani beach where we conducted our beach cleanup. After the beach cleanup we did a waste brand audit and recorded data on the wastes collected (25 bags) then we switched to sports where there were couple of sports and fun games such as tug of war, sac race, beach soccer and gymnastics.""

On that day the Sana Mare clean-up team and the other participants collected 313 kg of waste. The 5 most common items found were
1. Colored Plastic Beverage Bottles
2. Clear Plastic Beverage Bottles
3. Plastic cups
4. Clothes
5. Food wrappers

355,"Posted @withregram • @ocean.patrol Recebemos várias mensagens dos nossos COOLECTORS preocupados após encontrarem muitas TAR BALLS na praia da ALMAGREIRA. A equipa da OCEAN PATROL dirigiu-se ao local hoje e este já não se encontrava nas condições reportadas, porém 4 mulheres motivadas recolheram ainda algumas bolas de alcatrão e 61.40kg de lixo. 
🪨
Estas “bolas de alcatrão” são pedaços de petróleo bruto solidificados e encontrados no mar ou na costa, que ocorrem quando o petróleo bruto flutua na superfície do oceano, alterando a sua composição física num processo chamado “intemperismo”. 
🪨
Após um derramamento de óleo ou infiltração natural, o óleo espalha-se numa camada fina. O vento e as ondas quebram a mancha em pequenas manchas, ou bolas de alcatrão, que se espalham pelo oceano.
🪨
Inicialmente, os componentes mais leves do óleo evaporam ou dissolvem-se na água, deixando para trás os tipos mais pesados de óleo, como o petróleo. O petróleo mistura-se com a água salgada para criar uma substância espessa e pegajosa.
🪨
As novas bolas de alcatrão que aparecem na praia, especialmente em grande número, podem indicar um derramamento de óleo industrial
🪨
MAS as bolas de alcatrão também podem ocorrer naturalmente de fissuras no fundo do oceano, “lugares onde o petróleo apenas borbulha”.
🪨
A propagação de bolas de alcatrão depende de uma variedade de fatores, incluindo tempestades e mudanças nas correntes.

Also in California, endangered Coho salmon can finally make it upstream from the Pacific to reproduce thanks to the heavy rains late in 2021! This doesn't mean California is out of their drought just yet, but it's definitely a good sign 🐟

Across the Pacific, Coca-Cola has partnered with @theoceancleanup to intercept and clear waste in some of the world’s major rivers, starting with the Cần Thơ river in Vietnam. The project will remove 110,000 pounds of waste daily! 🤗 Coca-Cola also plans to make 100% of its packaging recyclable globally by 2025 and has committed to help collect and recycle every bottle and can it sells by 2030 😲

And hopefully everywhere soon enough, General Motors and FedEx have partnered to create zero-emission electric delivery trucks that can replace their more than 100,000 diesel-guzzling fleet 📦  UPS is also planning their own electric trucks and hopefully this momentum will push @amazon to do the same 🧐  Clean air is coming our way! 🥳

A new movement to tackle the scourge of Ocean trash and plastics has been launched with the coastal dwellers taking a giant leap.
Cleaner and Healthier Seas is our aim for Lagos State and Nigeria with our team taking out one pound of trash at a time from our beaches. This is the beginning of teamwork starting with the Marwa coastal communities we intend to partner with individuals, industry, NGOs, community, schools, government and the public to make our coast and beaches plastic free.

🌍 Plastics consistently make up 80% of all marine debris studied. There may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean. Weighing up to 269,000 tonnes. 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and 1 million sea birds are killed by marine plastic pollution annually. 🐢

376,"Every day, around 8 million pieces of plastic end up in our oceans. 🌊
It's damaging for marine ecosystems - animals end up eating the plastic and become tangled in it. 🐡
👉🏽That's why, from Friday until midnight Sunday, every order from our store will fund the recovery of a kilogram of ocean-bound plastic. 🥽
That's the equivalent of 50 plastic bottles. 🧴

377,"Check out this amazing rescue!! 🐢 

This incredible creature is a 270kg+ leather back turtle which has been saved from a swamp by these heroic Indonesian villagers. At first the villagers thought it was a crocodile due to its large head, but after noticing its beautiful shell they called local wildlife officers. They suspected that the giant tortoise had been washed ashore by the current. 🌊 🐢🏝

Leatherback turtles are listed as vulnerable and many types of leatherbacks are critically endangered, so they are a protected species in Indonesia. These rare turtles haven't been hunted or captures in 30 years.

383,"🚨UPDATE: The Ocean Cleanup
🌊Seit dem Launch von System 002 war Ocean Cleanup 47 Tage im Einsatz und hat durchschnittlich ca. 1000kg Plastik innert 24h gesammelt und aus dem Meer entfernt.

💨Die Wetterbedingungen im Winter haben die Arbeiten teils etwas erschwert, trotzdem sind sie auch in den Wintermonaten im Einsatz.

🐠Bei unserem letzten Post waren einige von euch um das Wohl der Fische und co. besorgt. Ocean Cleanup hat mehrere Methoden, um ihr System sicher zu betreiben:

1- Sie sind extrem langsam unterwegs, das heisst das Netz wird auch langsam gezogen. (0.5 -1.5 Knoten)
2- Es gibt einen Fluchtweg für Tiere am Boden der Auffangzone
3- Sie geben den Meeresbewohnern auch visuelle und akustische Hinweise, sodass sie das System sicher meiden oder navigieren können.
4- Ausserdem wurden in der Rückhaltezone mehrere Atemöffnungen geschaffen. Diese gewährleisten den Zugang zu Luft für Meeressäuger, Vögel oder Schildkröten, die versehentlich in das System gelangt wären. 
5- Es gibt einen Notfallschalter, welche das System im Notfall öffnen lässt.
6- Nebst Unterwasserkameras und Drohnen haben sie auch Menschen an Board, welche 24/7 die Tiere und die Umgebung beobachten

Wir wünschen @theoceancleanup weiterhin viel 🙌 Erfolg.

386,"Another ~50 lbs of marine debris (ft lots of ghost fishing line) off of Florida’s Coral Reef today thanks to our MLK Day of Service scuba cleanup with @mbshscuba of @mbseniorhigh! Thank you  @tarpoonlagoon & @decodivers305 for taking us out! 🤿⚓️🐠

What we do to keep our reefs healthy for all marine life needs to be carried through to what we do to keep our planet healthy for all humans 💙. Pollution & climate change disproportionately harm Black communities throughout our nation. Justice needs to be at the core of all environmental movements as we address some of the world’s most pressing problems. ✊🏾✊🏼

And equality needs to be at the core of all environmental work! People of color are underrepresented in environmental & marine science fields and in the scuba diving sport. We encourage you all to follow and support the nonprofit @blackinmarinescience, whose amazing team works everyday to empower the next generation of Black leaders in ocean science! 🖤🤍

May this MLK Day serve to inspire you to support ocean+environmental equality throughout the rest of this year and beyond ✨"

⁣
i had the opportunity to join @oursingaporereefs last weekend for a kayak and klean session at the sembawang @pa.passionwave site. with the monsoon flows bringing over lots of trash at high tide, we picked up over 80kg of trash from the simpang mangrove areas. 💪⁣
⁣
sometimes it gets a bit lonely picking up trash in a surfski built for one. so it was lovely to meet up with all the other trash picking folks. it's always nice to see all these people i'd only previously known on IG in-person. 😊⁣
⁣
kudos to @samdingoingon for being bold and picking up all the trash that we could fit into the kayak! i usually have to abandon a lot of large trash items since they don't fit into my surfski, so it was awesome to snag the crab basket and that 5 metre long pipe with barnacles together, ho ho. #teamworkmakesthedreamwork⁣

391,"Clean catch - 3/6 5000 km South 

1kg of fish = 1kg of plastic. For the amount you take from the sea you have to compensate, with the amount of waste you clean up. #fishing=>cleaning

During the journey I harvest my food from the sea, knowledge that I received from my ancestors from Brittany. The sea gives and takes, these are words I experienced as a child. Food that you catch, look for and swallow with respect is always better than a meal without origin wrapped in plastic.

When you harvest or catch something, clean up the mess you come across!

396,"Have you ever thought about what kind of “treasures” are resting at the bottom of your local river or lake?⁠
⁠
Well, here are some hints from Fredrik and @renamalaren, who do regular cleanups of Sweden’s third-largest lake (and source of drinking water), Mälaren. This autumn, one of their particularly productive sessions resulted in 1 car, 9 electric scooters, and 250kg of potentially toxic waste (such as batteries) being recovered. Earlier this year, they even stumbled upon a sunken boat full of stolen valuables. What an adventure!⁠
⁠
In 2021, volunteers from @renamalaren recovered and sorted more than 8 tons of dangerous waste in total from the lake’s bottom.⁠
⁠
Milkywire and all supporters of this project would like to wish Fredrik and the team fewer toxic finds in 2022.⁠
⁠
It’s all in our hands.⁠

397,"🌊 GOOD NEWS FOR THE OCEANS / No 8

Have you heard about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - the slow-moving whirlpools that pull litter from thousands of miles away into a single radius and create floating islands of plastic trash with an estimated size of 1.6 million square kilometers? 

We've got great news: 90% of this garbage could be removed by 2040 with the help of wonderkid Boyan Slat.

With his enterprise Ocean Cleanup Boyan has been designing and testing systems to collect the plastic trash. The first rig - named Jenny - was able to remove 9,000 kilograms of trash in the first trial. 

Well done Jenny! 

Now we need 10 more Jennies and 90% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch could be removed by 2040 according to @theoceancleanup. Keep up the amazing work!
